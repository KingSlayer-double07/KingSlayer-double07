# Hey there, I'm Favour – @favourdslayer

I'm a passionate self-taught developer who loves building mobile and desktop applications that solve real-world problems.

Whether it's a journal to keep your thoughts organized, a budgeting app to track your spending, or a personal tool that just makes life smoother, I bring ideas to life using **React Native**, **Tauri**, **Firebase**, and more.

### 🚀 What I Do
- **Cross-Platform Apps** – React Native for mobile, Tauri for desktop
- **Intuitive UI/UX** – Clean, minimal, and user-friendly designs
- **Offline-First Tools** – Apps that work even without an internet connection
- **Practical Projects** – I build tools I would actually use (and do!)
